# DevSalary
### Ivan Popovic and Simon Reinsperger

## Getting started
Install all dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
or
```
npm install
```

Get the development build pipeline and server running:
```
npm start
```
This will start watch tasks that will autorefresh the browser if files are changed.
Restarting the process is only required if new files are added.

A small extraction of the dataset (data/dataset_small.csv) is attached in this repo.
Because of its size the full dataset can't get checked in.
You can download the complete dataset from StackOverflow [directely](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B0DL28AqnGsrV0VldnVIT1hyb0E) and add it to the data folder as "dataset_full.csv".
